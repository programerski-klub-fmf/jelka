# Jelka FMF

Programmable Christmas tree at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, University of Ljubljana.

Visit the [Jelka FMF](https://github.com/Jelka-FMF) organization and [jelka.fmf.uni-lj.si](https://jelka.fmf.uni-lj.si/) for the new version.

## Directory Structure

* `patterns` - Contains patterns
* `library` - API that patterns should use
* `simulation` - Code for simulating tree in Pygame
* `hardware` - Code for running patterns on the real tree and server
* `development` - Development stuff

## Contributing Patterns

1. Install [required dependencies](requirements.txt). Currently, only [`pygame`](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/) is required for running the simulation.
2. Write and save your pattern inside the [`patterns`](patterns) directory. For inspiration, examples and help, you can check the existing patterns.
3. The pattern filename should describe the pattern or be your name. Each pattern also needs to contain a `# NAME: Your Pattern Name` comment with the pattern display name. The display name should be similar to the filename. Patterns with the display name `DEBUG` (case-sensitive) will be disabled and hidden.
4. It is recommended to use our simulation while testing your pattern. You can see the instructions for running the simulation below.
5. Once your pattern is ready, create a PR to this repository on GitHub.

## Running Patterns On Simulation

* Optional: Run `python simulation/simulation.py` to create a randomized tree file.
* Run `python -m patterns.one_color_change` from the repository root to run your pattern.

## Running Patterns On Raspberry Pi

* Connect GPIO 18 to a logic level shifter to 5V. Connect the output of the logic shifter via a 33 Ohm serial resistor to the data line of the strand.
* Connect to eduroam (optional): `nmcli --ask connection add type wifi con-name "edu" ifname wlan0 ssid "eduroam" -- wifi-sec.key-mgmt wpa-eap 802-1x.eap ttls 802-1x.phase2-auth mschapv2 802-1x.identity "as82306@student.uni-lj.si" 802-1x.password "selectdelete"` (good luck!)
* Clone this repository
* `cd hardware`
* `./chroot.sh start chroot`
* `useradd --system umetnik` (only once)
* `LEDS=600 KODA=geslo PORT=80 ./daemon.py`

To start the software at boot, you can use cron: `@reboot sleep 10; cd /root/jelka/hardware; ./chroot.sh start chroot; LEDS=600 KODA=abcd PORT=80 screen -dmS jelka ./daemon.py`
